# react-ghcal
## a react component to scrape and render your badass github contribution calendar in your super sick webapp...

### Why?
### Github api v3 has no goddamn endpoint for getting this.
### I have also created a function to scrape your Total Contributions as well.

NOTE: As of right now this is suuuuper clunky but it works! In its current form it's really not all that viable due to the heavy network lag and performance problems.... I'm looking into it.

Usage:

```yarn```

then

```yarn start```

The main business is done in src/Calendar.js

TODO:
- Fix clunkyness
- Add proptypes and proper testing 
- Add Total Contributions as optional prop
- Better styling
- An actual loading spinner
- Clean up and build for npm
